Loading the data and looking at it to see what I might want to look at

complaints <- readRDS('complaints.rds')

View(complaints)

```


First trend - most complaints

```{r}

# All of the data is from the year 2020

most_complaints <- complaints %>% 
 count(company) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

most_complaints

#interesting that the top 3 companies w/ the most complaints are substantially more

most_complaint_company<- complaints %>% 
  filter(company == c('Experian Information Solutions Inc.', 'TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.', 'EQUIFAX, INC.'))

most_complaint_company %>% 
  count(company_public_response)

most_complaint_company %>% 
  filter(company_public_response == 'Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law')

most_complaint_company %>% 
  count(company_response_to_consumer)
```
